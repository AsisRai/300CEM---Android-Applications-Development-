~~300CEM_Andriod_assignment - Asis
OLD IDEA: FLagBook

~~Scan flags/national flags to know what country’s flag it is (too hard, it did not work when i used Google's image API to scan the image(flag), it did not work every-time, therefore it is not viable)
New Idea (After some research)~

App Name: CovFreshersGuide

Main Aim: Help Freshers guide smoothly around Coventry and Coventry University by having locations of the important building displayed on the app and having the option for them to get to the places just by a tap of a button. Also, provide them with a checklist before starting university so that they do not miss any important events or things they are supposed to attend/collect.

Login : Register •	Full Name •	Course •	Faculty •	Student ID •	Email •	Phone Number

Before Starting Checklist: (dropdown?)(Tick boxes?)

•	Enrolment Checklist - Have a picture of Solar and add hyperlink to the pictures so that they can login to Solar and make sure they have everything checked out so there should be no problems when they start attending University. •	Id Collection - I didn’t know that i would have to go to the hub and collect my id when i started and i only knew this because i heard someone else talk about it, therefore have a picture of the HUB, and have the co-ordinates of the hub, so that the Google Maps API can be used to guide them to the hub and they can collect their ID’s.

Course Info:

•	Moodle : This is essential, can be a hassle every time going to the browser and googling ‘Cumoodle’ so that the link poops up to the Coventry Moodle. This will make it easier for them to top one button or picture and they are right directed directly to the login page, if they have their credentials saved them all they have to do is tap ‘Login’. •	Nova : This contains coursework covers and students letters etc. Most students do not know about this. •	University email : Again saving the hassle of extra 3-4 steps •	Top hat •	Student Timetable •	Attendance Checker - https://engagementdashboard.coventry.ac.uk/login

University Buildings; •	This will have all the university buildings such ex. Student Car park, Allen Berry and all its coordinates (accurate)so that the students can get there accurately and not approximately.

Student: •	Chat - This will be an open chat lines, where students from either same faculty(They can choose), or (they can choose) all faculty can chat with each other, so that the University remains friendly and well communicated. •	Notes - Personal Place where they may take photo and upload it, so that they do not forget important places/memories.
